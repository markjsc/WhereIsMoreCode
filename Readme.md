# Where is more code?

I would conservatively estimate that I've written several hundred thousand lines of code, designed or worked on several dozen systems and worked proficiently with languages/stacks ranging from Classic ASP, VB.NET, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, T-SQL, WPF/XAML, and more. One might wonder why I don't have more code in my Github account? Read on for the answers...

## Short Answer

The short answer is that I will be adding more code to [my GitHub account](https://github.com/markjsc) over the coming months and years, but I do not have any more public-facing code available to share at this time. See the Long Answer below for more details.

## Long Answer

I realize having a public-facing library of source code and/or a log of contributions to open source projects are virtually a requirement to be considered for work as a developer these days. Unfortunately, I have not (yet) positioned myself professionally or personally to fulfill this requirement.

Professionally, I have worked as an employee in two internal IT departments for the past 9 years - basically the entire time that Github has existed. Neither of my employers allowed sharing of the company's code as open-source. Additionally, I was not allowed to spend work time contributing to open-source projects.

Personally, my family situation has been very demanding of my non-working hours during roughly the same time period (children born, wife's business became very time-consuming, etc.). Unfortunately, this also prevented me from having the same level of free-time that I did a decade earlier (before open-source contributions were ubiquitous or assumed).

Needless to say, I am working to change the forces that I directly control - namely, making some adjustments to personal priorities. I also will be repositioning myself in order to influence the forces that I do not directly control - namely, making some adjustments to my professional situation. I'm expecting that both changes will result in more open-source and professional-related social contributions going forward.

## For Potential Employers/Clients: How do I know you're actually capable of delivering what you say you can?

Despite not having much source code to share, I have instead created a [Professional Portfolio](Portfolio/Readme.md). This document contains a showcase of systems I have designed and developed to solve a variety of business problems. These examples demonstrate the breadth and depth of my experience and capabilities.
